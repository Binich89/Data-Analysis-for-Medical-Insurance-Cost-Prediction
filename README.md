# Data-Analysis-for-Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting medical insurance costs based on various personal and lifestyle factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and medical conditions.
The goal is to identify the key factors influencing healthcare expenses and to build insights that can help both insurance companies and individuals make data-driven decisions.
The dataset contains demographic and health-related attributes like age, sex, BMI, region, smoking status, and presence of chronic diseases. Using Python and its data science libraries, the project performs comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and visualization to uncover patterns and correlations among these variables.
The project also explores how lifestyle factors (such as smoking and obesity) significantly increase medical costs and risk. Based on the analysis, the project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates a person’s expected insurance cost, which can help insurance companies in policy pricing and individuals in understanding their health-related financial risks.
Key Objectives
To clean and preprocess the medical insurance dataset for accurate analysis.
To explore and visualize relationships between variables like age, BMI, smoker status, and insurance cost.
To identify significant predictors of medical expenses.
To build insights for cost optimization and risk assessment in health insurance.
To prepare the data for predictive modeling using regression or machine learning algorithms.

A clear understanding of how demographic and lifestyle factors impact medical insurance cost using Insightful visualizations that show trends and risk factors.
Actionable findings to support preventive healthcare strategies and fair premium pricing.
